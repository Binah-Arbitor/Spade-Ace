// This file would contain advanced performance management
// For now, the performance modes are handled in crypto_engine.cpp

// Future implementations could include:
// - CPU affinity management
// - Memory usage optimization  
// - GPU acceleration integration
// - Load balancing across cores
// - Performance monitoring and adjustment
