// Attack method implementations
#include "../include/crypto_engine.h"

// This file would contain specialized attack method implementations
// For now, the attacks are implemented in crypto_engine.cpp

// Future implementations could include:
// - Advanced brute force with GPU support
// - Dictionary attack with word list management
// - Rainbow table lookups
// - Known/chosen plaintext attacks
// - Side channel analysis
// - Statistical attacks
